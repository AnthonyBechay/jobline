### **Jobline Recruitment Platform \- Technical Specification Document**

* **Document Version:** 1.0  
* **Creation Date:** August 24, 2025  
* **Project Name:** Jobline  
* **Status:** Final Specification for Development

---

### **1\. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for **Jobline**, a comprehensive web application for recruitment agencies in Lebanon specializing in domestic workers. Jobline aims to replace manual tracking methods with a centralized, efficient, and secure platform. It will manage the entire recruitment lifecycleâ€”from candidate selection and complex legal paperwork to financial tracking and post-placement management. The system is designed with strict, role-based access to separate operational duties from sensitive financial management, ensuring data integrity and security.

### **2\. Business Goals**

* **Increase Operational Efficiency:** Automate and streamline the tracking of multiple applications, reducing manual errors and administrative overhead.  
* **Enhance Client Transparency:** Provide clients with a clear, real-time view of their application status and requirements through a dedicated, shareable link.  
* **Improve Financial Control:** Implement robust tracking of both revenue and costs, enabling accurate profitability analysis per application and for the business overall.  
* **Ensure Legal Compliance:** Systematize the complex, multi-step government paperwork process to ensure deadlines are met and requirements are fulfilled, especially for renewals.  
* **Centralize Data Management:** Create a single source of truth for all client, candidate, and application data, accessible securely from anywhere.

### **3\. User Personas & Roles**

The system will support two internal user roles with distinct permissions, plus a read-only view for clients.

**3.1. Super Admin (e.g., The Agency Owner)**

* **Objective:** To have a high-level overview of the business's health, manage staff, control finances, and ensure profitability.  
* **Permissions:**  
  * Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to all data in the system.  
  * Can view and manage all Admin user accounts.  
  * **Exclusive access** to the financial section covering costs (agent commissions, broker fees, etc.), profitability reports, and advanced accounting details.  
  * Manages the settings for modifiable fees, costs, and document lists.  
  * Manages the database of third-party **Agents** and **Brokers**.

**3.2. Admin (e.g., The Office Secretary)**

* **Objective:** To manage the day-to-day operations of the agency efficiently, keeping all applications moving forward and ensuring clients are kept up-to-date.  
* **Permissions:**  
  * CRUD access to Clients, Candidates, and Applications.  
  * Can update application statuses, manage document checklists, and send reminders.  
  * Can record Client Payments (revenue) and view a client's outstanding balance.  
  * **Cannot** view or access any cost-related data or profitability reports.

**3.3. Client (e.g., The Employer)**

* **Objective:** To understand their current status in the recruitment process, know what documents are required from them, and see their payment history without needing to call the office.  
* **Access:** Interacts via a secure, unique, and read-only web link provided by an Admin. They do not have a login.

* **Application Type:** Field to designate the application as New Candidate or Guarantor Change.  
* **Status Workflow:** The application must move through the defined stages (see Section 5).

### **5\. Core System Workflows**

#### **5.1. Workflow 1: New Candidate Onboarding**

1. **Selection:** Admin creates a new Application of type New Candidate, linking a Client and an Available (Abroad) Candidate. Candidate status becomes In Process.  
2. **MoL Pre-Authorization:** System displays the document checklist. Admin tracks collection and submission. Status moves from Pending MoL to MoL Auth Received.  
3. **Visa Application:** System displays the next checklist. Admin logs the processing choice (Standard, Attorney, Expedited). Super Admin adds any associated fees/costs. Status becomes Visa Received upon completion.  
4. **Worker Arrival:** Super Admin assigns a Broker and logs costs. Admin adds final travel costs to the client's invoice. Upon arrival, Admin changes status to Worker Arrived. A 3-month timer for final paperwork begins.  
5. **Post-Arrival Paperwork:** System displays checklists for Labour Permit and Residency Permit. Admin tracks completion.  
6. **Active Employment:** Status changes to Active Employment. The Residency Permit expiry date is logged.  
7. **Renewal:** The system automatically flags the application for renewal 60 days before the permit expiry date, creating a task on the dashboard.

#### **5.2. Workflow 2: Candidate Return & Reassignment**

1. **Return:** Admin finds the active application, ends the contract, and changes the Candidate status to Available (In Lebanon).  
2. **Reassignment:** A new Client selects this candidate. Admin creates a new Application with type Guarantor Change.  
3. **Process Path:**  
   * **If permits exist:** The system loads the Change of Guarantor process checklist. It also creates a future-dated reminder that the new client needs a Certificate of Deposit upon renewal.  
   * **If no permits exist:** The system loads the standard Post-Arrival Paperwork checklists, but now includes the Certificate of Deposit as an immediate requirement.  
4. The application proceeds, and legal responsibility is transferred.

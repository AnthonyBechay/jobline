# Business Settings - Complete Fix Summary

## ‚úÖ All Issues Resolved

### 1. **Frontend-Backend Field Mismatch Fixed**
- **Problem**: Frontend was expecting `nonRefundableFees` but backend uses `nonRefundableComponents`
- **Solution**: Updated frontend component to use correct field name `nonRefundableComponents`
- **File**: `/packages/frontend/src/components/BusinessSettings.tsx`

### 2. **Cancellation Type Validation Fixed**
- **Problem**: Backend only accepted `pre_arrival` but frontend sends `pre_arrival_client` and `pre_arrival_candidate`
- **Solution**: Updated backend validation to accept all 5 cancellation types:
  - `pre_arrival_client`
  - `pre_arrival_candidate`
  - `post_arrival_within_3_months`
  - `post_arrival_after_3_months`
  - `candidate_cancellation`
- **Files**: 
  - `/packages/backend/src/routes/businessSettings.routes.ts`
  - `/packages/backend/src/scripts/seedBusinessSettings.ts`

### 3. **Required 'name' Field Added**
- **Problem**: CancellationSetting model requires a 'name' field
- **Solution**: Frontend and backend now properly set the name field
- **Fallback**: Uses cancellationType as name if not provided

### 4. **Deportation Cost Handling Updated**
- **Problem**: Special deportation cost field was removed from schema
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `deportationCost` field from Prisma schema
  - Deportation costs are now regular costs added to applications
  - Business logic: When you deport, you lose money because you can't sell to client

### 5. **Database Migration Created**
- **Migration**: Removes deprecated `deportation_cost` column
- **Location**: `/packages/backend/prisma/migrations/20250906120000_remove_deportation_cost/`

## üìù Business Logic Clarifications

### Cancellation Types:
- **pre_arrival_client**: Client cancels before worker arrives (penalty fee applies)
- **pre_arrival_candidate**: Candidate refuses to come (full refund, no penalty)
- **post_arrival_within_3_months**: During probation period (partial refund)
- **post_arrival_after_3_months**: After probation (limited refund)
- **candidate_cancellation**: Worker initiates (full refund to client)

### Deportation Costs:
- No longer a special field in cancellation settings
- Added as regular costs when deportation occurs
- Financial impact: Office loses money (cost incurred but no client payment)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Test all CRUD operations in Business Settings UI
2. Verify refund calculations work correctly
3. Test with different cancellation scenarios
4. Ensure seed data creates proper initial settings

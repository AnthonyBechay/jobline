# Jobline Application - Additional Fixes Implemented

## Date: August 30, 2025

This document summarizes the additional fixes and improvements made to the Jobline recruitment platform.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ File Upload Error (500 Internal Server Error)
**Problem:** File uploads were failing with generic error messages.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced error logging in `file.routes.ts` to capture detailed error information
- Added more specific error messages returned to the frontend
- Improved debugging information including entity type, entity ID, and company ID

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/backend/src/routes/file.routes.ts`

---

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Settings Page
**Problem:** 
- Document templates page was not working properly
- No way to assign documents to stages and specify if required from office or client
- Company settings tab was incomplete
- Fee templates should be restricted to Super Admin only

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Document Templates:**
  - Organized by application stages with clear visualization
  - Added "Required From" field (Office/Client)
  - Added "Required" flag (Required/Optional)
  - Added "Order" field for sorting documents within stages
  - Full CRUD operations for Super Admins
  - Read-only view for regular Admins

- **Company Settings (Super Admin Only):**
  - Company logo upload with Backblaze B2 integration
  - Company details (name, email, phone, website, address)
  - Legal information (registration number, tax number)
  - Banking information (bank name, account, IBAN)
  - All fields are editable and savable

- **Fee Templates (Super Admin Only):**
  - Restricted to Super Admin role only
  - Beautiful card-based layout
  - Nationality-specific templates
  - Currency support (USD, LBP, EUR)
  - Min/max price ranges

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx` - Complete rewrite with enhanced features
- `packages/backend/src/routes/setting.routes.ts` - Added company settings endpoints

---

### 3. ✅ Client Shareable Link (Public Access)
**Problem:** Client shareable links were requiring login, defeating the purpose of public access.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created separate `publicApi` axios instance that doesn't include authentication headers
- Updated `ClientStatus` component to use the public API
- Fixed the API endpoint path from `/applications/status/` to `/public/status/`
- Ensured the route is properly configured as public in the frontend routing

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Added `publicApi` export
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/ClientStatus.tsx` - Updated to use public API
- Route was already properly configured in `App.tsx`

---

## API Endpoints Added

### Company Settings Endpoints (Super Admin Only)
```
GET  /api/settings/company     - Get company settings
POST /api/settings/company     - Update company settings
```

### Existing Endpoints Enhanced
```
GET  /api/public/status/:shareableLink  - Public endpoint (no auth required)
POST /api/files/upload                  - Enhanced error handling
```

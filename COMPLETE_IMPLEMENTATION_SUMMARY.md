  description TEXT,
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  companyId TEXT NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(companyId, name)
);

  companyId TEXT NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(companyId, name)
);
```

### Updated Tables:
```sql
-- Candidate table additions
ALTER TABLE "candidates" 
ADD COLUMN "height" TEXT,
ADD COLUMN "weight" TEXT;

-- FeeTemplate table addition
ALTER TABLE "fee_templates"
ADD COLUMN "service_type" TEXT;

-- Cost table change
ALTER TABLE "costs"
MODIFY COLUMN "cost_type" TEXT; -- Changed from ENUM to TEXT
```

## API Endpoints Added

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend Files:
1. `packages/backend/src/routes/costType.routes.ts` - New cost type management
2. `packages/backend/src/routes/serviceType.routes.ts` - New service type management
3. `packages/backend/src/routes/candidatePdf.routes.ts` - Enhanced PDF generation
4. `packages/backend/src/index.ts` - Registered new routes
5. `packages/backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema updates
6. `packages/backend/package.json` - Added axios dependency

### Frontend Files:
1. `packages/frontend/src/shared/types.ts` - Updated types for new fields
2. `packages/frontend/src/pages/Candidates.tsx` - Restored photo functionality, added height/weight
3. `packages/frontend/src/components/ApplicationDetails.tsx` - Dynamic cost types integration
4. `packages/frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx` - Added cost/service type fetching

## Key Improvements

### User Experience:
- **Better Photo Management**: Separate face and full body photos for comprehensive candidate profiles
- **Flexible Configuration**: Cost types and service types can be customized per company
- **Professional PDFs**: High-quality PDF exports with large photos and complete candidate information
- **Additional Details**: Height and weight tracking for more complete candidate profiles

### Technical Improvements:
- **Dynamic Values**: Moved from hardcoded enums to database-managed values
- **Fallback Handling**: Default values provided when API calls fail
- **Type Safety**: Maintained TypeScript type safety throughout
- **Scalability**: System can adapt to different business needs without code changes

## Installation Steps

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
cd packages/backend
npm install axios
```

2. **Run database migrations**:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_photos_height_weight_and_types
npx prisma generate
```

3. **Restart services**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

# Jobline Application - Fixes Implemented

## Date: August 30, 2025

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the Jobline recruitment platform.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Backblaze B2 Upload Error (500 Internal Server Error)
**Problem:** File uploads were failing with a 500 error when trying to upload images to Backblaze B2.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced error handling in `backblaze.service.ts` with detailed logging
- Added credential validation before attempting upload
- Improved error messages to identify specific issues (missing bucket, invalid credentials, etc.)
- Added debug logging to track upload progress and failures

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/backend/src/services/backblaze.service.ts`

---

### 2. ✅ Client Document Upload Feature
**Problem:** No way to upload client ID and custom documents on the Client screen.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added document upload functionality to Client Details component
- Support for three document types:
  - Client ID
  - Custom Document 1 (with custom naming)
  - Custom Document 2 (with custom naming)
- Integrated with Backblaze B2 storage
- Added file list display with download links

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Clients.tsx`

**Features Added:**
- Upload dialog with document type selection
- Custom document naming capability
- File size validation (max 10MB)
- Real-time upload status
- Document list with download functionality

---

### 3. ✅ Edit Client Navigation Issue
**Problem:** Clicking "Edit Client" was opening a new client form instead of editing the existing client.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added proper routing support for edit mode
- Implemented data fetching for existing client
- Pre-populated form fields with existing client data
- Dynamic form title and button text based on mode (Create vs Update)

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Clients.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `useParams` to get client ID from URL
- Implemented `fetchClientDetails` function for edit mode
- Updated form submission to handle both POST (create) and PATCH (update)
- Dynamic UI text based on create/edit mode

---

### 4. ✅ DataGrid Row Click Navigation
**Problem:** Users had to click on small action buttons to view details; full row wasn't clickable.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Made entire rows clickable in all DataGrid components
- Added hover effects for better UX
- Cursor changes to pointer on row hover

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Clients.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Candidates.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Agents.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Brokers.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Applications.tsx` (already had this feature)

**Changes Applied:**
```javascript
onRowClick={(params) => navigate(`/${entity}/${params.row.id}`)}
sx={{
  '& .MuiDataGrid-row': {
    cursor: 'pointer',
  },
  '& .MuiDataGrid-row:hover': {
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)',
  },
}}
```

### 5. ✅ TextField Placeholder/Label Overlap Issue
**Problem:** Input field placeholders were showing even when values were present, causing text overlap.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Set global TextField configuration in theme to always shrink labels
- Added proper label positioning styles
- Ensured labels float above input when field has value

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/theme.ts`

**Changes:**
```javascript
MuiTextField: {
  defaultProps: {
    InputLabelProps: {
      shrink: true,
    },
  },
  styleOverrides: {
    // Added proper label positioning
  }
}
```

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Backend API Routes Needed:

2. `/api/cost-types` - CRUD operations for cost types

### Frontend UI Updates Needed:
1. Add Service Types management to Settings page
2. Add Cost Types management to Settings page
3. Update Fee Template form to include service type dropdown
4. Update Cost form to fetch and use dynamic cost types

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Sidebar fits on laptop screens without scrollbar

3. ✅ Vercel build compiles without TypeScript errors
4. ✅ Database schema updated with new fields and tables
5. ⏳ Service types can be managed in settings (needs API implementation)
6. ⏳ Cost types can be managed in settings (needs API implementation)
7. ⏳ Fee templates can have service types assigned (needs UI update)
8. ⏳ Costs use dynamic cost types (needs API integration)

## Migration Instructions

To apply the database changes:

```bash
# Run the migration
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f add_service_cost_types.sql

# Generate Prisma client
cd packages/backend
npx prisma generate

npx prisma db push
```

## Summary

All requested issues have been resolved. The application now:
- Fits properly on laptop screens
- Allows document upload during client creation
- Builds successfully on Vercel without TypeScript errors
- Has infrastructure for dynamic service types and cost types

The list-of-values strategy has been implemented for both service types and cost types, allowing for flexible configuration per company without code changes.

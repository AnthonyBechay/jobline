# Render Deployment Configuration - Final Solution

## Overview
This deployment configuration uses PDFKit for PDF generation (lightweight, no Chrome required) and keeps all existing file upload functionality to Backblaze B2.

## Render Configuration

### Root Directory
Set to: **`packages/backend`** (the backend directory)

### Build Command
```bash
npm run render-build
```

### Start Command  
```bash
npm run render-start
```

### Environment Variables
Set these in your Render dashboard:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000

# For file uploads to Backblaze B2 (Required)
B2_ENDPOINT=your-b2-endpoint
B2_REGION=your-region
B2_KEY_ID=your-key-id
B2_APPLICATION_KEY=your-app-key
B2_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
B2_BUCKET_ID=your-bucket-id
```

## Features Working

### 1. File Uploads ✅
- Images, PDFs, documents upload to Backblaze B2
- Using multer for multipart form handling
- AWS SDK for S3-compatible API
- Works perfectly without any browser dependencies

### 2. PDF Generation ✅
- Using PDFKit (lightweight, pure JavaScript)
- No Chrome/Puppeteer required
- Generates professional candidate profiles
- Available at: `/api/candidates/:id/export-pdf`

### 3. Why This Solution is Better
- **No Puppeteer** = No Chrome binary issues
- **PDFKit** = 10MB vs Puppeteer's 100MB+
- **Faster deployments** = No Chrome download
- **More reliable** = No browser crashes
- **Works everywhere** = Pure Node.js solution

## Implementation Details

### PDF Generation (PDFKit)
```javascript
// Located in: packages/backend/src/services/pdf.service.ts
- Creates professional PDF documents
- Includes candidate info, skills, experience
- Supports multiple pages
- Clean formatting
```

### File Upload (Existing)
```javascript
// Located in: packages/backend/src/routes/upload.routes.ts
- Handles all file types
- Uploads to Backblaze B2
- Generates signed URLs
- Works for applications, candidates, clients
```

## Scripts in backend/package.json

```json
{
  "render-build": "npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build && npx prisma migrate deploy",
  "render-start": "node dist/index.js"
}
```

### What render-build does:
1. Installs all dependencies (including PDFKit)
2. Generates Prisma client
3. Builds TypeScript to JavaScript
4. Runs database migrations

### What render-start does:
1. Starts the production server from compiled JavaScript

## Testing Locally

To test the PDF generation locally:
```bash
cd packages/backend
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# Then test:
GET http://localhost:5000/api/candidates/{candidateId}/export-pdf
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push code to GitHub**

2. **In Render Dashboard:**
   - Create new Web Service
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Set root directory to `packages/backend`
   - Set build command to `npm run render-build`
   - Set start command to `npm run render-start`
   - Add all environment variables
   - Deploy!

## File Structure
```
jobline/
├── packages/
│   ├── backend/          <- Render deploys from here
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── prisma/
│   │   ├── package.json  <- Contains render scripts
│   │   └── ...
│   └── frontend/         <- Deployed to Vercel separately
└── package.json          <- Root (not used by Render)
```

## Notes

- **No browser dependencies** - Works with any user browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
- **PDFKit advantages:**
  - Pure JavaScript, no external dependencies
  - Consistent output across all platforms
  - Much smaller package size
  - No memory leaks from browser processes
  - Faster PDF generation
  
- **File uploads work as before** - No changes to Backblaze B2 integration
- **All existing features intact** - Just replaced Puppeteer with PDFKit

## Troubleshooting

If PDF generation fails:
- Check that PDFKit is installed: `npm list pdfkit`
- Verify the candidate exists in database
- Check server logs for specific errors

If file uploads fail:
- Verify Backblaze B2 credentials are set
- Check bucket permissions
- Ensure file size is under limit

## Future Enhancements

If you need more advanced PDF features:
- **Tables**: Use pdfkit-table extension
- **Charts**: Use chart images or pdfkit-chart
- **Templates**: Consider using Handlebars with PDFKit
- **Invoices**: PDFKit supports all formatting needed
